Logic Building Assignments 🧠
A simple collection of C language assignments focused on building fundamental problem-solving and programming skills. These include character handling, patterns, array processing, and numerical logic.

📁 Repository Contents
This repository contains multiple example programs in C, each illustrating key concepts:

PatternXXX.c – Print alphabets/numbers in various repeating/alternating designs.

CountDigits.c – Identifies and processes elements in arrays (e.g., counting 3‑digit numbers).

LastOccurrence.c – Finds the last index of a number in an array.

DifferenceMaxMin.c – Computes the difference between the highest and lowest array elements.

SumOfDigits.c – Calculates sum of digits for each element in an integer array.

CheckAlpha.c, DisplaySchedule.c, etc. – Handle character validation and branch-based messaging.

(Replace these with your actual file names and descriptions.)

✅ Features / Key Learning Objectives
Each assignment demonstrates:

Input validation using scanf.

Loops (for, while) and conditional branching (if / else).

Array traversal and in-place processing.

Modular programming via functions.

Basic memory management (malloc, free) where used.

Edge-case handling (zero, negative numbers, invalid input, etc.).

🛠️ Compilation & Execution
To compile and run any assignment:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcc <source-file.c> -o <executable-name>
./<executable-name>
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcc CountDigits.c -o CountDigits
./CountDigits
📌 Example Walkthrough
Assignment: Count and display 3-digit numbers in an integer array.

Prompts for array size.

Reads array elements.

Iterates through each element:

Converts negative numbers to positive.

Repeatedly divides by 10 to count digits.

Displays any numbers with exactly 3 digits.

c
Copy
Edit
if (digitCount == 3) {
    printf("%d\n", originalNumber);
}
🧩 Extending the Assignment
Want to try more?

Change patterns—alternate even/odd rows, uppercase/lowercase letters, or numeric shapes.

Extend array logic—count specific digits, filter prime numbers, or manipulate each element.

Refactor to use switch statements or pointers.
